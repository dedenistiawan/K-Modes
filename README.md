# k-modes
An implementation of K-Modes algorithm in R

K-modes algorithm is a simple clustering method used in machine learning and data mining area. There are many implementations of this algorithm in most of programming languages. R languae also has its own implementation as well. However, to have a strong understanding of the algorithm, I developed it in R.
